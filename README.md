# Bikesharing Analysis

## Overview of the Project
The goal of this project was to determine the viability of a bikesharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. Using data from Citibike in New York City, we could use the information to make informed decisions on the possible levels of success. I was able to use both Pandas to scrape and transform the data and Tableau to create visualizations that would be able to tell a story of the opportunity we might see in the Iowa market.

### Analysis of the Project

- The majority of bike rides taken by users in New York City are very short distances and only last about 5-15 minutes per ride.

- As seen above the majority of those bike riders in New York City are men, and the most common ride time for them is 5 minutes.

- The most common ride time for a rider is in the early evening of 5-7 pm on weekdays. We also see an increase in rides during early morning hours and Saturdays.

- Both men and women are using the bikes in the early evenings. Women do not use the bikes nearly as much as men on weekends and very rarely use them late at night, where as men will still use the bikes in the later evenings.

- The amount of subscribers that use Citibike are often 8-15x greater than customers. So the more that you can get someone to sign up for a subscription, the more use and retention you can see.

- Most bikes need around 100 to 300 repairs over the course of the bike life. Doing further analysis to look at miles on each bike in correlation to repair needs could help us learn on often repair can be expected as well.

#### Summary of the Project
The initial information pulled from New York is great. There is a strong appetite and success for a bikesharing program. The next step would be to pull information from Des Moines area. A major point is to see how much foot traffic is in the city versus the amount of cars? Is there a strong cycling culture already created? This would require information on Iowa, but even we could pull more information on New York. We could look to find visualizations based on weather patterns and how colder and warmer weather affects the use of the cycles. Further, we could look at how weather affects bike repairs. There is a wealth of data that we can still explore and a wealth of opportunity in this sector.
