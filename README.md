# Bikesharing Analysis

## Overview of the Project
The goal of this project was to determine the viability of a bikesharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. Using data from Citibike in New York City, we could use the information to make informed decisions on the possible levels of success. I was able to use both Pandas to scrape and transform the data and Tableau to create visualizations that would be able to tell a story of the opportunity we might see in the Iowa market.

#### Summary of the Project
The initial information pulled from New York is great. There is a strong appetite and success for a bikesharing program. The next step would be to pull information from Des Moines and the area. A major point is to see how much foot traffic is in the city versus the amount of cars? Is there a strong cycling culture already created? This would require information on Iowa, but even we could pull more information on New York. We could look to find visualizations based on weather patterns and how colder and warmer weather affects the use of the cycles. Further, we could look at how weather affects bike repairs. There is a wealth of data that we can still explore and a wealth of opportunity in this sector.
